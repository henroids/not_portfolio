    <h2>
      Why hello!!... I didn't even notice you over there... Just kidding, I have google analytics and hotjar installed, and I check them religiously, so I’ve been watching you the whole time. I’ll be brief because I know you're probably time-poor. my name is henry, and I am a ux/ui designer with an insatiable thirst to learn and an obsessive compulsion to push around little digital boxes 1 pixel at a time... for hours (for anyone looking to hire me, I was just kidding, I’m waaay more efficient than that). I am also capable of doing enough user research to know that everyone who's anyone that has portfolio, proclaims how much they love ux/ui in their "about me" section, but I would never grab such low hanging fruit... Call me and let’s talk about it instead. Well, if you've made it this far without skipping ahead, then I am truly impressed with how literate we both are... email me, and let’s talk about it.  
      <br>
      <br>
      ps. If you're reading this, that means my site isn't finished, and yet in defiance of all logic, I have given you the link to judge it. that was dumb of me, but i was just so excited to get the chance to talk to you.
