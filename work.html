        <ul>
          <li>The website's layout and aesthetics are bloated and dated</li>
          <li>The organization does not use social media to increase awareness of their cause</li>

      <p>Improve the site to make it easier for users to spread the word and start grassroots movements.</p>

      <h2>Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Respondents believe that some wrongful convictions are an unavoidable side effect of a working justice system, but the current rate is too high</li>
        <li>More than half of respondents believe that prison sentences are often too harsh</li>
        <li>Those affected by alleged wrongful convictions felt the justice system was weighed against them or that they were poorly represented in court</li>
        <li>100% of respondents think that donating money, raising awareness, and seeking legal aid are the most effective ways to help those affected by wrongful convictions - however, none knew where or how to go about doing so.</li>

    <p>Research showed that people want to get involved, but don't know how. Looking at other organizations may inspire ideas for how to increase engagement.
      <br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, the California Innocence Project offers even more features than most of its counterparts throughout the country. This is evidence that even though the organization is making the effort to incorporate key features, there is something that is not clicking with users who visit the site.

  <div class="sitemap">
    <h2>Redesigning the Sitemap</h2>
    <p>Since CIP's content is fairly robust, user testing for new features was deprioritized to focus on usability of the existing design. Testing results showed that the website's navigation was bloated and confusing.

    <p>Amanda, a passionate activist with little money to spare, can easily share content on her social media profiles and quickly sign up for volunteer opportunities.</p>
    <img src="/not_portfolio/images/User_Flow_-_George.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p>Meanwhile, a successful lawyer named George is too busy to volunteer his time, but has multiple paths to donate and can easily set up recurring donations..</p>

      <p>More user testing confirmed that the sitemap and userflows successfully consolidated the website's information, and made it easier for users to find their preferred method of getting involved.

      <p>The final round of user tests indicated that a dark background with vibrant colors spoke most directly to young activists. Animations and microinteractions used in a light, tasteful way made the site feel less "corporate" and more fun. Most importantly, creating a prominent and frictionless sharing flow encouraged users to spread the word via social media.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>An organization like CIP can and should harness the power of social media to further its cause. Whether they speak directly to their community, or simply let others spread the word for them - the end result is an amplified voice that can ripple out beyond their current reach and the effects have the potential to shift public outlook entirely. Combine that push for increased social media presence with an updated look and a sleek experience that speaks to young activists and you have a recipe for real social change.</p>
